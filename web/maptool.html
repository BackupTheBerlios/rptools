MapTool

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Our brother wanted to join our group from NV (we're in TX), and we
sought to solve all of the long-distance role playing hurdles.  Voice,
text, die rolling, and the battle map.

<p>
For voice we recommend Skype.  It has echo-cancellation that makes it
superior to all the other voice sharing tools out there, and this
was a huge consideration because there were speakers and "open" microphones
at both ends so that the remote player could hear everyone at the table
and everyone could hear him.

<p>
For die rolls and "private" messages we used the text chat boxes of Skype
or other instant messaging clients.

<p>
For map sharing, we started with Klooge Werks.  A very fine piece of code
that is reasonably priced.  However our GM's "I'll describe, you draw"
style was not very well supported by KW's drawing tools nor is it scalable (the GM is the only one that can draw/move things).  What we really
wanted was something much simpler which actually just made small
improvements over the
battlemap, minis, and wet-erase pens.  KW does a whole lot more than
what we were looking for.
