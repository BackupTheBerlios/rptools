<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
We found that we wanted to augment our pen-and-paper roleplaying
(primarily 3.5ed D&amp;D) with computer aids.  

<p><a href="dicetool.html"><code>dicetool</code></a>
is a simple but powerful expression parser that has built in functions
for random number generation and can be further extended by JavaScript
to do all sorts of calculations.  

<p><a href="maptool.html"><code>maptool</code></a> is an elegant graphical
tool to share maps (images) and map data (drawings, markers, grid placement) in a client/server fashion between multiple players.

<p>
At this point we are still preparing our source code for uploading to the
sourceforge CVS tree.  We will prepare both source and binary downloads for
both tools soon.

<p>
Keep in touch on our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rptools/">SourceForge project page</a>
