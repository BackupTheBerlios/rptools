DiceTool
</font>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
We came up with <code>dicetool</code> while GMing.  There were frequent
multi-dice rolls and tabulation was slow sometimes.  We looked
at and tried many of the fine dice rolling apps out there, but
they all lacked features we wanted (such as saving complicated
expressions for re-rolling), and had features we didn't care for
(such as cute pictures of the dice).


<h2>Features</h2>

<p>
<ul>
    <li>user defined JavaScript functions
    <li>buttons have names to summarize the expressions
    <li>aggregating syntax for auto-summation
    <li>tabs for organizing by party, by encounter, however you wish
    <li>changes you make may be saved between sessions
    <li>9 quick roll buttons modified by a quantity pulldown
    <li>variables on tool can be used in expressions or javascript functions
    <li>d20 style '1'='miss' and '20'='critical threat' rule highlighting
    <li>select (ctrl or shift-click) output rows for summation
    <li>platform-agnostic Java (either as WebStart or downloaded application)
    <li>Java 1.5 (WebStart supported)
</ul>

<h2>Version</h2>

<p>
<code>dicetool</code> is currently released as 1.0M1.  Roadmaps and release notes are in the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=132209">Forums</a>.
