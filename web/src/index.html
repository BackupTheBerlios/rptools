<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
We found that we wanted to augment our pen-and-paper roleplaying
(primarily 3.5ed D&amp;D) with computer aids.  

<p><a href="dicetool.html"><code>dicetool</code></a>
is a simple but powerful expression parser that has built in functions
for random number generation and can be further extended by JavaScript
to do all sorts of calculations.  

<p><a href="maptool.html"><code>maptool</code></a> is an elegant graphical
tool to share maps (images) and map data (drawings, markers, grid placement) in a client/server fashion between multiple players.

<h2>Availability</h2>

<p>
Source code for both projects is available now via our 
sourceforge.net's CVS repository.  Check
out our 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rptools/">SourceForge project page</a> for details or to browse.  
Both <code>dicetool</code> and <code>maptool</code> are available now 
from our launch links at the left.  This will run them as Java Web Start
applications.   You need Java 1.5 to run either tool.  Use the 
Get Java Now link to download that from java.com.
Additional downloads may be made available from time to time -- such as 
executable jars.   V
Please see our <a href="download.html">Downloads</a> page or the 
navigation bar to the left or the SourceForge project File release.
