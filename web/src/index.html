Role Playing Tools
</font>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
We found that we wanted to augment our pen-and-paper roleplaying
(primarily 3.5ed D&amp;D) with computer aids.   These tools 
extend and augment our traditional playing style.  They are not
a role playing game by themselves, nor are they meant to replace
everything at the D&amp;D table.
</p>

<p><a href="dicetool.html"><code>dicetool</code></a>
is a simple but powerful expression parser that has built in functions
for random number generation and can be further extended by JavaScript
to do all sorts of calculations.  
</p>

<p><a href="maptool.html"><code>maptool</code></a> is an elegant graphical
tool to share maps (images) and map data (drawings, markers, grid placement) in a client/server fashion between multiple players.
</p>

<p><a href="tokentool.html"><code>tokentool</code></a> is an accessory to
maptool.   Drag any image onto the workspace and use the mouse to move and zoom
the image in the reticle.  Then drag from the preview pane directly onto
maptool -- or File->Save to save a png file.

<h2>Availability</h2>

<p>
You need Java 1.5 to run these tools, click <a
href="http://jdl.sun.com/webapps/getjava/BrowserRedirect?locale=en&host=www.java.com:80">Get Java Now</a> here or to the left to install Java 1.5 on your
computer.
</p>

<p>
You can launch the tools directly from the website using Java Web Start.  
JWS caches the files and controls launching the app for you from the
cache.  In the future we will have JWS ask you if you want to
install start links (e.g. on the Desktop or Start Menu), but for now you need
to be connected to our website to run.  This is advantageous as we currently
expect frequent releases and JWS will download any new files it needs.
</p>

<p>
Source code is available now via CVS on SourceForge.  Check out our <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rptools/">SourceForge project page</a>
for details or to browse.
