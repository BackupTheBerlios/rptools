MapTool

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Our brother wanted to join our group from NV (we're in TX), and we sought to
solve all of the long-distance role playing hurdles.  <a
href="voice.html">Voice</a>, text, die rolling, and the battle map.
There are tools available for many of these problems.
<p>
For map sharing, we started with Klooge Werks.  A very fine piece of code
that is reasonably priced.  However our GM's "I'll describe, you draw"
style was not very well supported by KW's drawing tools nor is it scalable
(the GM is the only one that can draw/move things).  What we really
wanted was something much simpler which actually just made small
improvements over the
battlemap, minis, and wet-erase markers.  KW does a whole lot more than
what we were looking for.
