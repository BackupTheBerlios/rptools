<h2>Anatomy</h2>

The <code>dicetool</code> window is broken into five main parts.<br>

<a target="_new" href="dicetool/docs/images/Screenshot-new-tab-shown.png"><img align=right src="dicetool/docs/thumbs/Screenshot-new-tab-shown.jpg" height=243 width=150/></a>
<ol>
<li>The 9 "dice" buttons and the quantity pulldown.  (top left)  Use these to quickly roll $quantity d $dice.  5d6 is just a click and that can be changed to 15d6 in a blink.  One might use this for rolls that aren't on a button yet, perhaps that surprise wisdom check your GM just asked you to roll.
<li>The results table.	(entire right)
<li>Button tabs. (center left)  Use the Tab menu to create, rename, or remove Tabs from this pane.  The tab shown was renamed from the default to 'New Tab'.
<li>Variable boxes. (two rows near bottom)
<li>summation total display (bottom line)
</ol>

<p>
One would enter expressions into the boxes on the Tab.  Pressing the Roll
button next to it will send the expression to the results table.  Optionally,
the Roll button can be right-clicked to be renamed.

<h2>Expression Syntax</h2>

<p>
<code>4d8+11</code> will just do the right thing, but there is so much more to
this tool.   The Help->Syntax gives a breakdown of the expression language,
essentially $quantity d $die + $addition with arbitrary values for $quantity,
$addition, and $die will show you a result.  

<p>
When you roll with these simplified expressions <code>dicetool</code> will just
show the single total.  To show each roll separately use something like
<code>4[d8]+11</code>.  This works, but the last result is d8+11, which isn't
perfect.  To make this result look better you can use the expression
<code>4d8:11</code> which uses the accumulation operator <code>:</code> (more
on that later).


<h3>Accumulating and Non-Accumulating rolls</h3>

We saw one form of an accumulating operator above, when we used 4[d8] in an
expression.  The results table for this expression showed four lines, with a
column keeping a running total.  Sometimes the running total is not
appropriate.  To roll 4d8 and just give you the number for each roll use the
<code>{}</code> syntax: <code>4{d8}</code>.

<h2>Extending with JavaScript</h2>
<p>
<A CLASS="external" HREF="dicetool/functions.js"><code>functions.js</code> is a JavaScript functions file</A> <a href="functions.html">What's This?</a><br>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<ol>
<li>Thrask the Barbarian has 3 attacks, Power Attack, and Combat Expertise
 <ul>
	<li>set the following variable names <code>BAB, STR, PA, EX</code>, leave PA and EX defaulted to 0 for now.  Fill in BAB with your current Base Attack Bonus (say 11), and your STR with your current Strength ability modifier (say 6 for an 18 strength and a two-handed weapon).
	<li><code>att(20)+BAB+STR-PA-EX; att(20)-5+BAB+STR-PA-EX; att(20)-10+BAB+STR-PA-EX; 2d6+STR+PA: 2d6+STR+PA: 2d6+STR+PA</code>
	<li>You can name this button 'Full Attack'
	<li>You will get six results.  The first three are not accumulated, and
are the respective to-hits.  The damage follows, and is accumulated.  If all
three hit the total is right there.  If two hit, you can select the two damage
rows and the total will be shown at the bottom of <code>dicetool</code>.
